# Auto-Detection Logic Explanation

## UART Device Detection

The UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) devices are detected using a nested loop that iterates over different baud rates, RX (Receive) pins, and TX (Transmit) pins. The `sendAndCheckResponse` function sends an identification request and checks for the expected response. Detected UART devices are stored in the `UARTDeviceInfo` structure.

## I2C Device Detection

I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) devices are detected by iterating over different SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock) pins. The Wire library is used to communicate with I2C devices. The detection involves checking if the bus is available at a specific address. Detected I2C devices are stored in the `I2CDeviceInfo` structure.

## SPI Device Detection

SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) devices are detected by iterating over different CS (Chip Select) pins, SPI modes, bit orders, and data rates. The SPI.beginTransaction function is used to set the SPI settings, and a dummy transfer is performed to check for a valid response. Detected SPI devices are stored in the `SPIDeviceInfo` structure.

## LED Indication

A visual indication using an LED (Light Emitting Diode) on pin 13 is implemented to blink when a device is successfully detected.

## Maximum Device Counts

Maximum counts for detected devices are set to 10 for UART, I2C, and SPI. Modify these constants if more or fewer devices need to be supported.

## Functionality

The `initializeLED` function sets up the LED pin, and `blinkLED` is used for visual feedback on successful device detection.

## Setup and Loop

The `setup` function initializes Serial communication, sets up the LED, and calls `detectAndPrintDevices` to start the auto-detection process. The `loop` function is left empty for user-specific logic.
