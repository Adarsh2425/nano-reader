# UART Auto-Detection and Reading Example

This Arduino sketch demonstrates UART auto-detection and reading from devices on different RX and TX pins. The code checks for connected devices and reads data from each detected device.

## Overview

The project consists of an Arduino sketch written in C++ using the SoftwareSerial library. Key features include:

- UART auto-detection of connected devices on various RX and TX pins.
- Reading data from each detected UART device.

## Dependencies

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- [SoftwareSerial library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SoftwareSerial)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Open the Arduino IDE.

3. Install the SoftwareSerial library if not already installed. Go to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Manage Libraries..." and search for "SoftwareSerial."

4. Open the main sketch file (`sketch_jan9c.ino` or similar) in the Arduino IDE.

5. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.

6. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. The sketch will automatically detect UART devices connected to various RX and TX pins during setup.
2. Detected devices and their information will be printed to the Serial Monitor.
3. Data will be read from each detected device and printed to the Serial Monitor.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during device detection or reading, review the Serial Monitor output for more information.
