# SPI Auto-Detection and Reading Example

This Arduino sketch demonstrates SPI auto-detection and reading from devices on the SPI bus. The code checks for connected devices and reads data from each detected device.

## Overview

The project consists of an Arduino sketch written in C++ using the Arduino SPI library. Key features include:

- SPI auto-detection of connected devices on the bus.
- Reading data from each detected SPI device.

## Dependencies

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Open the Arduino IDE.

3. Open the main sketch file (`sketch_jan9b.ino` or similar) in the Arduino IDE.

4. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.

5. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

## Project Structure

- `sketch_jan9b.ino`: The main Arduino sketch file.

## Configuration

- No specific configuration is required for this example.

## Usage

1. The sketch will automatically detect SPI devices connected to the bus during setup.
2. Detected devices and their information will be printed to the Serial Monitor.
3. Data will be read from each detected device and printed to the Serial Monitor.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during device detection or reading, review the Serial Monitor output for more information.
